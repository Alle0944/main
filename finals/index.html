				<p class="mainbody">Hip Hop has become one of the most popular music genres with millions of people listening to it every day. Hip Hop culture has taken over the United States, especially within the youth. It wasn’t always like this though, Hip Hop’s humble beginnings and  rich history brought it to the success it has today.</p>

					<p class="blockheader">The Early Days</p>

					<p class="blockbody">Hip Hop was born from the genres of disco and funk in the Bronx. People began bringing sound systems to block parties on the streets. At these block parties DJs would play popular songs mixed with percussion instruments. DJs would use a Mixer and two turntables to play tasty beats that fuel the block party fun. Hip Hop would experience a revolution with a new technology called a drum machine. These machines would become affordable which allowed people to create their own drum beats with ease. Eventually people began using a chanting vocal style over their beats which led to the origins of the MC. People would talk or chant along to the beat of the drums. DJ Kool Herc was an artist that many people consider to be the godfather of hip hop culture. Kool Herc was one of the first people to incorporate mixing, scratching and toasting into his songs. 

					The MC started out as a person on stage that would talk between artists and songs. They would act as a hype man in order to get people in the crowd to get out of their seats. They would crack jokes or spit a few rhymes. Eventually these sessions would become longer and slowly they developed into rapping over beats.</p>

					<p class="blockheader">The 1980's</p>

					<p class="blockbody">The beginning of the 80’s were the era of what is now known as “old school” hip hop. Before this era most hip hop tracks were simply played live at house shows but during this time artists started recording their tracks. By 1982, Hip Hop started to permeate throughout the United States with many major cities starting to take notice. In the 80’s hip hop started experimenting with different styles, with fusions of disco and electronic music. By the mid 80’s is when people started to incorporate rock samples into their hip hop music which marked the end of the Old School era. In the 80’s is when hip hop started becoming more lyrical and more refined.

					In the latter half of the decade hip hop really started to find its footing. From 1983-1986 is considered the new school era. This is the second wave of hip hop and featured artists such as Run D.M.C. and LL cool J. Hip hop started getting more mainstream appeal with each coming year, albums were more cohesive and serious. The era was capped off by the Beastie Boys reaching the number one spot on the billboard charts with their album License to Ill. 

					During the final years of the 80’s Hip hop began what is known as the Golden age of hip hop, which would last long into the 90’s and was all kicked off by the release of License to Ill. Just before the end of the decade, N.W.A. released their hit album Straight Outta Compton. The album sold 10 million copies and with it formed a new subgenre of hip hop… Gangsta Rap. </p>

					<p class="blockheader">The 1990's</p>
					<p class="blockbody">Kicked off in the 80’s the golden age of hip hop is in full swing. Revolutionized by N.W.A., Gangsta rap became very popular. The sounds were aggressive and the content violent, fans ate it up. Along with Gangsta rap’s popularity came with it a slew of controversy. The violent content concerned a lot of parents and politicians. N.W.A. even received a letter from the F.B.I expressing their resentment towards their song “Fuck tha Police.”

					The 90’s also marked an age where hip hop was immensely popular. The genre had found its way to all parts of the country as well as many parts of the world. Hip hop elements also started to be incorporated into pop songs.

					Between the years of 1991 to 1997 there was a well known rivalry between the East and West coast hip hop scenes. The rivalry was focused on two main artists, Notorious B.I.G. from the east and Tupac from the west. The rivalry between the two coasts fueled many classic projects from this era. The Golden Age of hip hop ended when both Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac were murdered in drive by shootings.</p>

					<p class="blockheader">The 2000's</p>
					<p class="blockbody">During the 2000s a new era emerged called the Bling Era. This was a commercially influenced type of hip hop. The bling era was centered around talking about jewelry and material objects. Although this era is generally considered a step down in terms of quality compared to many other eras, there were some very influential artists to come out from this time period. 

					Along with this, there was a lot of experimentation within the scene during this time period. Many genres were fused together and created a subgenre of Alternative hip hop. Artists such as OutKast, Kanye West, and MF DOOM created some very classic albums.</p>

					<p class="blockheader">The 2010's</p>
					<p class="blockbody">The 2010s is the modern era of hip hop. The genre has changed so much compared to the previous eras. The internet really drove the sounds of this era, as music is so easily accessible now. People are able to be found so much easier than ever before with sites like spotify, apple music and soundcloud.  

					The 2010s are defined by trap music and “mumble rap”. This type of hip hop is melodic, autotuned and drugged out. Artists such as Migos, Future, Lil Uzi Vert, and Playboi Carti really helped push this type of music. There is also an emerging Drill scene that started in Chicago that is defined by hyper violent lyrics and aggressive flow. Chief Keef is credited with creating the subgenre of hip hop. Because the internet makes music more accessible than ever, there are more types of hip hop than ever before. Artists like Kendrick Lamar have been keeping lyrical, more old school hip hop alive. Death Grips has pioneered the hyper experimental “industrial” hip hop that lead to more abrasive sounding tracks. In 2017, Hip hop music became the most popular genre in the country for the first time ever. It is truly the best time to be a fan of hip hop.</p>
